# Built for Collaboration

All of TBD's projects are open source. We're building digital infrastructure as a public good. And that requires a broad ecosystem of partners, contributors, and diverse users.

Our [Collaboration repository](https://github.com/TBD54566975/collaboration) is the home for  all of TBD's development efforts. It outlines the tbDEX and Decentralized Identity systems we're building.

* [Discussions](https://github.com/TBD54566975/collaboration/discussions)
* [Issues](https://github.com/TBD54566975/collaboration/issues)

## Current Status

All projects in the TBD family are in early prototyping. New contributors should 
expect a pace of development consistent with nascent technology: larger commits, 
frequent refactoring, changing APIs, and incomplete featuresets. We believe: _open source
is not a publishing medium_. These projects are open from the start to welcome your
interest, invite discussion, identify early issues, and advise on design. An early
adopter mindset will work well until these projects mature further.

The Discussion forums and Issue trackers are likely the best way to get involved now. Our
project leads may be able to guide your efforts and incorporate your feedback in ways that
will be most meaningful to you and the project's goals.

In particular, we want to ensure the New Contributor Experience is as smooth as possible.
You should be able to:

* Understand each project's goals and scope
* Install prerequisite dependencies
* Clone and build the project
* Run the tests
* Join the conversation in Discussions and Issues
