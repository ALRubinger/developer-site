# Built for Collaboration

All of TBD's projects are open source. We're building digital infrastructure as a public good. And that requires a broad ecosystem of partners, contributors, and diverse users.

## Current Status

All projects in the TBD family are in early prototyping. New contributors should 
expect a pace of development consistent with nascent technology: larger commits, 
frequent refactoring, changing APIs, and incomplete featuresets. We believe: _open source
is not a publishing medium_. These projects are open from the start to welcome your
interest, invite discussion, identify early issues, and advise on design. An early
adopter mindset will work well until these projects mature further.

The [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/MASAPKPYJM) and Issue trackers are the best way 
to get involved.

In particular, we want to ensure the New Contributor Experience is as smooth as possible.
You should be able to:

* Understand each project's goals and scope
* Install prerequisite dependencies
* Clone and build the project
* Run the tests
* Join the conversation in Discord and Issues

### Decentralized Web Platform (DWP)

The Decentralized Web Platform provides the base for building decentralized applications. The principal component for this project is `dwn-sdk-js`, a JavaScript implementation of the [Decentralized Web Node Specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/).

### Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Projects 

The Self Sovereign Identity Projects provide the building blocks for SSI work: verifiable credential issuance and verification, decentralized identifiers, and an in-the-box SSI Service. These projects 
are also used in the Decentralized Web Platform (DWP).

### tbDEX

`tbDEX` is a liquidity protocol. It's the first application to be developed by TBD built atop the Decentralized Web Platform. Its [whitepaper](https://tbdex.io/whitepaper.pdf) outlines a "protocol (that) facilitates decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for
establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials
(VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real world".

Building `tbDEX` as a specification and message format is work that will follow the foundational projects under active development with the Decentralized Web Platform (DWP).
